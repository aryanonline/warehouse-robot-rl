# üöÄ Reinforcement Learning for Warehouse Robot Navigation

## üìå Project Overview
In modern warehouses, **autonomous robots** play a crucial role in efficiently transporting goods. This project explores how **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** can be used to train a **robot to navigate a warehouse** while **avoiding obstacles, workers, and minimizing collisions**. The goal is to **deliver as many boxes as possible** while ensuring safety and optimal energy use.

This project simulates a **grid-based warehouse environment**, where the robot must:
- Navigate **without colliding with workers or fixed equipment**.
- Optimize **path efficiency and delivery rate**.
- Handle **stochastic movement errors** to simulate real-world uncertainty.
